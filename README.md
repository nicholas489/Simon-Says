This Java program is a simple memory game that involves the user memorizing a pattern of coloured buttons that are displayed on a Graphical User Interface, 
created using the JFrame library. The user is then challenged to repeat the pattern by clicking on the buttons in the correct order. Each time the user 
accurately repeats the pattern, the game makes the sequence of buttons in the pattern longer and more difficult to remember. Enjoy the game and see what's
the highest score you can get!

(Note: This is Version 1.0, the GUI will be rewritten using ReactJS soon)
